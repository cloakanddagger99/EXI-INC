Harlan Electric\u2019s certified live line crews have been performing energized work there since 2020 to help meet Eversource New Hampshire\u2019s growing need for energized work due to outage constraints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The utility needed to execute the X116\/Z119\/S188\/R187 transmission project to ensure reliability to their customers after problems with existing wooden laminate poles were discovered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the structure replacements (227 of 252), which converted the existing poles to light duty steel monopoles, were performed under energized conditions. With the four transmission lines on the same right of way, Harlan Electric needed to carefully plan out and coordinate the switching of lines being worked on by the 2-3 live line crews, 4 drilling crews and 4 access subcontractor crews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day, crews would discuss working procedures for every task planned to be completed that day. This allowed them to identify location hazards ahead of time and maintain the awareness necessary to prevent unplanned outages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to their careful and methodical efforts, not a single unplanned outage occurred during the project.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7768\" style=\"width:275px;height:412px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-1067x1600.jpg 1067w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1113resized-1-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo courtesy of Eversource<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exemplary Safe<\/strong>ty<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite extensive barehand live line work on the project, the Harlan Electric team\u2019s daily safety procedures, briefings and culture kept the workers safe during the six months of line construction in 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those daily procedures included conducting a thorough job brief and detailed work plan, including the barehand procedures, at the start of work each day to make sure every member of the team understood their role and responsibilities and who would perform each task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That care, communication, and planning paid off. There were zero recordable incidents, only one first aid, and no property damage during the project. Harlan Electric\u2019s New Hampshire district earned both the NECA Zero Injury and NECA Safety Excellence recognitions for its entire 2022 safety record, which included this project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Protecting Wildlife<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the project was awarded, an unforeseen challenge arose. New Hampshire\u2019s Fish &amp; Game Agency issued new protections for a number of rare, threatened and endangered species that would need to be adhered to during the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harlan Electric worked closely with the utility to determine what changes and procedures would be necessary to comply and then made sure its subcontractor handling access and environmental controls built and maintained those requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The essential protections included additional timber access matting and silt fence surrounding upland work pads. Operable fences had to be stationed at every work pad entry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crews worked hand in hand with full time environmental monitors in the field daily. Visual inspections were performed around each piece of construction equipment prior to operation to ensure no wildlife had entered the immediate work area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Details:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.harlanelectric.com\/projects\/x116-z119-s188-r187-transmission-structure-replacements\/\">X116\/Z119\/S188\/R187 Transmission Structure Replacements<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our companies are transmission experts serving utilities throughout the U.S. and in Canada. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/capabilities\/transmission-construction\/\">See what they can do for you<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NECA honors team for exemplary work in Overhead Transmission Performing hundreds of structure replacements under energized conditions would be a challenge in and of itself, without any additional factors.
