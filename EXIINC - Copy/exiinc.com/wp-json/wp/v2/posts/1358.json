With this population explosion, the families visiting the local Children\u2019s Hospital have been feeling the squeeze. Despite opening less than 10 years ago, patient volume projections were met within two years of opening in 2008. Since then, hospital administration has worked towards fulfilling the need for expansion and additional offerings to better serve families in Broomfield and the surrounding rural communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expected to complete in late 2019, the new 200,000 square-foot expansion will be approximately four times the size of the current space. Additional services will include emergency\/urgent care, inpatient and observation care, sleep studies, operating room services, specialty clinics, an imaging center, pharmacy, optical shop, food services, gift shop, and diagnostic unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is being delivered under a multi-party Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) agreement. IPD was born out of a belief that traditional contracting approaches create barriers to collaboration, transparency, and trust. IPD principles combine a project\u2019s various partners and contractors into a unified team under a single contract, emphasizing shared risk and reward. Basic tenets of IPD include communication, consensus, team building, innovation, accountability, and transparency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTraditionally in construction, you often see teams work only for themselves,\u201d says Sturgeon Electric Operations Manager, George LaClaire. \u201cThey are self-motivated to protect themselves at all costs, even if it means others fail. Over the years, I\u2019ve been in meetings with 20 or 30 people in the room, and only one person is speaking. On this project, we want to leverage the collective brain. We don\u2019t want to miss out on all the experience, expertise, great ideas, and creativity that everyone brings.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children\u2019s Hospital hired Sturgeon Electric as the project\u2019s electrical contractor, along with Denver-based Treanor HL as project architect, and GH Phipps Construction Company (GH Phipps), based in Greenwood Village, Colorado, as contractor. Sturgeon Electric was selected early on as the project\u2019s first construction team member, working closely with project stakeholders and hospital representatives to provide guidance on construction design, and even selection of the project\u2019s general contractor, engineer, and additional trade partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sturgeon Electric has been sharpening its skills on Colorado projects embracing IPD principles over the past few years, such as the new Centennial Peaks Hospital in Louisville, Children\u2019s Hospital in Colorado Springs, and St. Francis Hospital in Denver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt can certainly take time to build trust and consensus among team members, which is challenging when everyone comes from different organizations, mindsets, and cultures,\u201d LaClaire says. \u201cA paradigm shift in thinking must take place. Instead of thinking about what\u2019s best for you or your organization, you must think about what\u2019s best for the project. However, in my opinion, the environment and culture we\u2019re forming here is a significant improvement over traditional, more adversarial scenarios.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to several other specialty contractors, Sturgeon Electric, Treanor HL, and GH Phipps collocate on-site. This helps to foster efficient decision-making and team consensus on project goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChildren\u2019s Hospital is a very special place, and the delivery method we have is special as well,\u201d says Chris Goldy, senior project manager for GH Phipps. \u201cYou have the opportunity to make a difference and have some impact on what\u2019s happening here.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s easier, and we\u2019re able to save some money, then the team members share that reward and so does the hospital. If they can share in this reward, maybe they\u2019re able to build out part of the facility that would not otherwise be built out,\u201d says Tal Clark, project executive for U.S. Engineering, the project\u2019s mechanical contractor. The team is hopeful that the IPD process helps to make the construction process more successful, profitable and enjoyable for all project partners. They are excited to harness the talents and insights of everyone to optimize results, increase value to Children\u2019s Hospital, and most importantly, serve the kids of northern Colorado.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sturgeon Electric Company, Inc. -- Integrated Project Delivery - Children&#039;s Hospital Colorado\" width=\"1778\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/C-1A0Cyap_Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><span class=\"has-inline-color has-myrgroup-blue-color\"><strong>OVER THE YEARS, I\u2019VE BEEN IN MEETINGS WITH 20 OR 30 PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, AND ONLY ONE PERSON IS SPEAKING.
