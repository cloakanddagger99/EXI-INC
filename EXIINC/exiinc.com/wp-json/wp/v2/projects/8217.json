Myers served as both the general contractor and electrical contractor for the Gateway to Roxford 345kV transmission line, a 13.52-mile stretch from substation to substation \u2013 approximately 7 miles of which is located on Chouteau Island on the Mississippi River outside of St. Louis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally installed in 1968, the existing steel lattice towers needed replacing. The project included the removal of all existing COR-TEN lattice towers and driven pile foundations, as well as the existing conductor. Old materials were replaced by 59 self-supporting lattice towers, ranging from 93-235 feet, and the installation of a double-circuit, double-bundled 795 kcmil ACSS conductor. The project also required the installation of two overhead optical ground wire (OPGW) shield wires and permanent lighting, as mandated by the FAA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the island was primarily accessible via weight-limited bridges, L.E. Myers needed to create out-of-the-box solutions to ensure the project was completed safely, to the client\u2019s expectations and met USACE and FAA requirements. This problem-solving approach was recognized by NECA, the premier organization for electrical contractors in the United States.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related News: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/news\/the-l-e-myers-co-and-sturgeon-electric-company-honored-at-neca-2022-convention\/\"><strong>The L.E.
