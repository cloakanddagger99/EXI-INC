In true Doc fashion, he helped establish three training programs, and his son is now also employed at Sturgeon Electric. Throughout his career, the Mountain State apprenticeship program has more than tripled its number of participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doc Weaver became involved in the industry in 1948 when he took his first job as a groundman. By 1977, Doc became part of the MYR Group family when the company he was working for was bought by The L.E. Myers Company, where he spent the majority of his career until his retirement from Sturgeon Electric Co. Inc as Group Vice President. He was an active and early advocate of apprenticeship programs, and, during his tenure, worked closely with organizations like The Mountain States Line Construction Apprenticeship Training Program. In 2001 he received the L.E. Myers Award in recognition of all he contributed to both the company and the industry as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1983, Doc Weaver himself signed Mark\u2019s indenture papers and Journeyman Lineman Certification. \u201cDoc was an icon in this business,\u201d Mark said in his acceptance speech, \u201cHe paved the way for people like myself and other line workers who worked in the trade, worked with the tools, and had the opportunity to receive leadership development and business training to put back into our industry.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mountain State Line Constructors recognizes Sturgeon Electric regional vice president in appreciation of his significant and outstanding contributions In the world of outdoor electrical work, William \u201cDoc\u201d Weaver is a household name representing the exemplary journeyman lineman.
