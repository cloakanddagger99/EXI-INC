Now, the region will benefit from a vastly different commodity \u2014 sunshine. Since July 1, the Battle Mountain Solar energy and storage facility has captured and converted its rays into clean electricity for NV Energy customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Constructed by MYR Group subsidiary MYR Energy Services (MYRE) for ConEd Clean Energy Businesses, Battle Mountain is a 139 MWdc \/ 101 MWac solar photovoltaic facility with 100 MWh \/ 25 MWdc battery energy storage (BESS). Part of NV Energy\u2019s overall sustainability strategy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nvenergy.com\/cleanenergy\/renewable-energy-portfolio\/solar-resources\">Battle Mountain Solar<\/a> is among the largest DC-coupled solar and battery storage systems in the U.S.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/YKVEl3H1x4I\"><strong>Watch<\/strong><\/a><strong> some of the solar module installation and hear more from the MYRE team about Battle Mountain Solar+Storage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"MYR Energy Services - Battle Mountain Project - Safety Appreciation Event\" width=\"1778\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YKVEl3H1x4I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Biere, vice president of operations for MYRE\u2019s solar division, said employing DC-coupled battery storage remains a \u201cpretty unique solution\u201d for utilities. It\u2019s also a valuable one as it allows excess energy to be captured to batteries throughout the day directly from the solar panels. Then the excess energy can be distributed earlier or later in the day when less power is being generated. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MYRE leaders brought more than 30 years of combined solar experience and expertise to the job. As the Engineer-Procure-Construct (EPC) contractor, MYRE guided the project from design to completion \u2014 a major advantage for any client.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/MYRE-Battle-Mountain-Solar-Project.jpg\" alt=\"MYR Energy Services installs solar panels at the Battle Mountain Solar and Storage Project.\" class=\"wp-image-3163\" style=\"width:500px;height:282px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/MYRE-Battle-Mountain-Solar-Project.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/MYRE-Battle-Mountain-Solar-Project-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The EPC process also allowed for real-time input on the engineering phase. \u201cIt affords us the opportunity to optimize the design,\u201d Project Manager Jason Schacht explained. It also provides better awareness of when materials will arrive and helps the entire process run smoother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite supply chain volatility from COVID-19 and western wildfires, MYRE was able to procure all the necessary materials to keep the project moving on time, including trackers, inverters, and battery storage system. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to MYR Group\u2019s robust, nationwide fleet also ensured essential equipment and tools were always at the ready. MYRE cleared the site, installed underground and above ground electrical work, and installed 294,000 solar photovoltaic modules on the 1-square mile site. The project broke ground in August 2020 and was completed in June 2021. Adhering to high standards contributed to the project\u2019s success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><em><strong><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-myrgroup-blue-color\">&#8220;It&#8217;s an awesome experience, working with awesome people in the office and awesome people in the field.
