<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Brown\u2019s skepticism crept in for this meeting in 2020. Was Sturgeon Electric actually interested in helping his business grow and develop or was the company simply meeting a state requirement?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be a situation where Sturgeon needed me to get their quotas done and meet the state\u2019s requirements,\u201d Brown admits from his office two years after that first meeting. \u201cBut it never was that way. All of the people I worked with at Sturgeon were exactly who I met at the first meeting. They never belittled me, they never put me in a position to fail. They did nothing but genuinely help me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown enthusiastically describes all the ways in which Sturgeon Electric helped him grow his business and develop his individual skills as a business owner over the past two years, from how to best bid a job and estimate it to billing in cycles and accurately calculating a project\u2019s progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown\u2019s small electrical business has been around since 2001, mostly working in the restaurant space, but grew from six employees to 16 before settling at nine since taking on work at DEN as a trade partner of Sturgeon Electric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHonestly, being a minority contractor, I really didn\u2019t think it would be the kind of relationship that it is,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t at first understand how Sturgeon really did want to pull in minority companies, small businesses and teach them how to become good contractors. I just didn\u2019t think it was going to be that way, but that\u2019s exactly what it is.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown and III D Electric are just one of many trade partners Sturgeon Electric work closely with on the DEN concourse expansion projects and others, relationships the company places tremendous pride and value in creating, maintaining, and growing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce Perkins, vice president of Sturgeon Electric\u2019s Colorado Commercial and Industrial (C&amp;I) division, sees the diverse vendor utilization program as far more than a requirement. For him, it\u2019s an opportunity to help Sturgeon Electric as a business make a significant, positive impact on the state\u2019s electrical industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These trade partners often specialize in scopes of work Sturgeon Electric doesn\u2019t such as mechanical work, which longtime partner Solutions Mechanical has performed after the two companies formed a relationship through the program. And thanks in part to Sturgeon Electric\u2019s willing mentorship, Solutions Mechanical grew its business to include an electrical division after gaining additional work and experience in partnership with Sturgeon Electric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe partnership has been fantastic for us because when we have an opportunity for work, we can blend our skills together. Many of these businesses have areas they do really well,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cTogether, we can carry the entire project and go after those opportunities. We know we have a proven relationship and can partner up and go after this work together. I think it\u2019s a reciprocal relationship from a business standpoint.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sturgeon Electric\u2019s commitment to working with disadvantaged trade partners includes hosting outreach events for local vendors who meet certain criteria such as a Diverse Business Enterprise (DBE), Minority\/Women Business Enterprise (MWBE), Small Business Enterprise (SBE), and Emerging Business Enterprise (EBE).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-myrgroup-blue-color has-text-color\" style=\"border-color:#ffffff\"><blockquote><p>They never belittled me, they never put me in a position to fail. They did nothing but genuinely help me.<\/p><cite>&#8211; Darnell Brown, Owner, IIID Electric<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Sturgeon Electric\u2019s embrace of the program stood out so much that Denver mayor Michael B. Hancock wrote a <a href=\"https:\/\/sturgeonelectric.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sturgeon-Electric-Letter-From-the-Mayor.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">letter thanking the company<\/a> on behalf of the city and county of Denver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe certainly were not expecting that,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cIt was exciting and rewarding for all the effort we\u2019ve put it to make this program work well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working closely with each diverse vendor partner, Sturgeon Electric provides guidance and mentorship to help smaller businesses continue developing skills and enhancing their capabilities. Sturgeon Electric helps these diverse vendors learn more about areas such as project management, billing and invoicing, and other critical aspects of the construction process on larger projects like the work at DEN.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen the request was made, Sturgeon Electric came together to brainstorm ideas on how it could be accomplished,&#8221; Operations Manager Norberto Cruz said, having served as Sturgeon Electric\u2019s senior project manager on the DEN project. &#8220;When we thought about it, it was about managing risk, however, ensuring everybody\u2019s success.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sturgeon Electric set up a specific project manager and superintendent to work with their disadvantaged trade partners, with another team set up to manage its scope of work, all housed under one senior leader for the projects as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while there was a dedicated support system internally for the disadvantaged trade partners, everything toward the project was handled as one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSturgeon Electric\u2019s success was dependent upon the success of others. If they failed, we failed,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHelping people succeed is what sets you apart from other companies who don\u2019t help guide, provide direction, or promote growth.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For disadvantaged businesses, one of the requirements of the program is to be below an annual revenue of $15 million per year. So, no one company could take on too much of the work&nbsp;or they\u2019d risk breaking that ceiling. At the same time, they couldn\u2019t take on more work than their workforce or experience would allow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was the beauty of partnering with Sturgeon Electric. They always communicated and Brown&nbsp;found the support he needed to learn and develop. His businesses developed key aspects like improving safety and paperwork.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any notion of skepticism Brown felt at the beginning is now long gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis program was by far the best thing that could happen to any small business simply because this program is teaching smaller contractors \u2013 that have no idea how to do work like that \u2013 how to grow the business and start doing the work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not be able to go out there and bid on a $50 million project, but we can definitely bid on a $2 million contract. I\u2019ve built those capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in growing your company and making your company better, hands down this would be a smart decision.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div data-wp-interactive=\"core\/file\" class=\"wp-block-file\"><object data-wp-bind--hidden=\"!state.hasPdfPreview\"  class=\"wp-block-file__embed\" data=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SECO-DEN-Diverse-Vendor-Kudos.pdf\" type=\"application\/pdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px\" aria-label=\"Embed of SECO-DEN-Diverse-Vendor-Kudos.\"><\/object><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-6d9e30e2-c82e-4a69-9777-a018a45c3294\" href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SECO-DEN-Diverse-Vendor-Kudos.pdf\">SECO-DEN-Diverse-Vendor-Kudos<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SECO-DEN-Diverse-Vendor-Kudos.pdf\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-6d9e30e2-c82e-4a69-9777-a018a45c3294\">Download<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Details:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/sturgeonelectric.com\/projects\/denver-international-airport-dia\/\">Denver International Airport (DEN)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you a diverse firm looking to partner with one of our companies?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/contact\/vendors\/\">Find out how<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Denver mayor Michael B.
