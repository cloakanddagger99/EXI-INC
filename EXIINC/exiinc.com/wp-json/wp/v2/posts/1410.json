Collectively, participants then develop root cause, action plans, and timelines to effect positive change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations Manager George LaClaire has used this proactive planning tool capaciously, witnessing time after time how it aids the strengthening of relationships and delivery of successful projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has been instrumental in expanding its use and acceptance throughout Sturgeon Electric and externally among clients, owners, and other trade partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong advocate for Sturgeon Electric\u2019s adaptation of Lean practices, George has been an integral part of this cultural shift that has transformed the ways team members perform, communicate, interact, and engage with each other. Lean practices include many tools and methodologies that work to eliminate waste and improve flow efficiencies, with the goal of being better tomorrow than you are today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Lean approach is the use of \u201cA3 Thinking,\u201d a structured problem-solving and continuous improvement approach that provides a simple, strict procedure to guide problem-solving. George recognized that Rocks in the Road was an ideal process for implementing A3 thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late August, George conducted the \u201cRocks in The Road, An A3 Thinking Experience\u201d workshop hosted by the Lean Construction Institute (LCI) of Colorado at the Association of General Contractors (AGC) of Colorado headquarters in Denver. To attract a multi-disciplinary audience, he invited members of LCI and AGC. The interactive workshop content and format were well-received by the 36 attendees who represented a strong cross-section of construction professionals ranging from architects, owners, general contractors, and mechanical and plumbing trade partners. Two LCI representatives also attended and are working with George to further develop Rocks in the Road as an approved LCI offering that can be distributed to various LCI communities of practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color has-myrgroup-blue-color\"><p><strong>AS AN EDUCATOR, I FOUND THIS TO BE A GREAT HANDS-ON LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHOWING HOW TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING.
