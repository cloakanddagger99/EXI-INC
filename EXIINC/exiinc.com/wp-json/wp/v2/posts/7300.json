Getting involved in an activity that supports the community was a great way for our leaders to start the program by interacting with each other and enhancing their communication tactics as they built trust and prepared for the week ahead. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MYR Group partnered with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wishforwheels.org\/\">Wish for Wheels<\/a>, a nonprofit organization that provides bikes to Title 1 schools and children in need. There was no better way to engage the team and empower children in the community than to take part in their <em>Team Build and Give<\/em> program which offers organizations a chance to build and gift bikes to an entire second-grade class. MYR Group employees had the opportunity to gift children at Slater Elementary School, in Denver, Colo., with new bikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon arriving at the school, MYR Group employees were paired to participate in a variety of trivia questions to complete the bike build challenge. With more than 40 participants and volunteers, MYR Group gave 28 new bikes and helmets to the students at Slater Elementary and set in motion a healthier and brighter future. When the kids arrived, they were smiling from ear to ear. It was a special moment for the MYR Group team to reflect and help kids who may not own a bike or in some cases have never learned to ride. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThe opportunity to build a bike, then present it to a child, and in my case: then teach the child how to ride a bike, was an extremely rewarding process.
