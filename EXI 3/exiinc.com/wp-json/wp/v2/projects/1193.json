The podium features retail, office, and event space with residential units wrapped around the garage, eliminating an exposed parking podium or dark facades on all sides of the complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complex, which topped out mid-summer 2021, is being built through \u201ctop down\u201d construction, meaning the permanent structure of the basement was constructed while excavation took place above and below the slab on-grade. Upon completion in 2022, One Chicago will be the city\u2019s sixth tallest building.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Huen Electric crews are helping transform the Windy City skyline with their buildout work on One Chicago, a near-supertall skyscraper under design-build construction at the corner of Chicago Avenue and State Street in downtown\u2019s River North\/Gold Coast neighborhood.
