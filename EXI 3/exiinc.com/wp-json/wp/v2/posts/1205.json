For the recently completed segment, crews wrecking out six miles of a 230kV line and built a 345kV line in its place. As construction ramps up, crew sizes will likely double to 120 or more craft workers, including subcontractors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to play a significant role and are delighted to further expand our long-term working relationship with LS Power through this important initiative.\u201d &#8211; MYR Group President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Swartz says. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the project contract, valued at $250-plus million, MYR Energy Services will provide project management, construction management, material procurement, and construction services, including right-of-way clearing, environmental controls, foundation installation, structure assembly, and erection and conductor stringing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With construction now under way, the project\u2019s scheduled in-service date will occur in late 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Details: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/projects\/central-east-energy-connect\/\"><strong>Central East Energy Connect<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Central East Energy Connect Project -- MYR Energy Services, Inc.\" width=\"1778\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EXfqPL33gcc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" src=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Marcy-to-New-Scotland-17-2-1600x899.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-774\" srcset=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Marcy-to-New-Scotland-17-2-1600x899.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Marcy-to-New-Scotland-17-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Marcy-to-New-Scotland-17-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Marcy-to-New-Scotland-17-2-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Marcy-to-New-Scotland-17-2.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration between our companies is a key advantage we can provide to customers for transmission and other projects. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/capabilities\/transmission-construction\/\">Discover more of our transmission capabilities<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MYR GROUP AND MYR ENERGY SERVICES TEAM FOR UPGRADE PROJECT THAT WILL INCREASE TRANSMISSION CAPACITY, DELIVER MORE RELIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY TO HIGH-DEMAND AREAS MYR Group and MYR Energy Services are working now on the Central East Energy Connect in New York for which nearly 100 miles of 345-kilovolt (kV) transmission construction will be constructed within [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":773,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[90,91,92],"class_list":["post-1205","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-all-news-stories","category-our-company","category-projects","subsidiary-myr-energy-services","subsidiary-myr-group"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1205"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/10"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1205"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1205\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9404,"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1205\/revisions\/9404"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/773"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1205"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/myrgroup.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1205"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
