This problem-solving approach was recognized by NECA, the premier organization for electrical contractors in the United States.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis was an extremely complex project that required extensive planning, coordination, and communication,\u201d Tibbetts said. \u201cThe L.E.

Working in a building with 70-foot ceilings, and 70 percent cold storage came with unique challenges and experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work included installing conduit, wire, light fixtures, hundreds of pieces of electrical equipment, dock door controls, BAS raceways and cable, the fire alarm system and low voltage and security raceways. Boyle and his team developed new solutions as the project called for them, such as the volume and redundancy of light fixtures that inspired the development of a simpler system for hanging them. That new method reduced costs and saved time without sacrificing quality, structural integrity, or safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also offered value engineering solutions to Shamrock Foods, including recommending more efficient location of transformers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSturgeon Electric was a fantastic partner. They went out of their way to help design or redesign areas for efficiencies and for longevity,\u201d Shamrock Foods\u2019 Vice President of Construction and Engineering Patrick Greiner said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prefabrication also helped avoid pandemic supply chain challenges, increase quality and consistency, and saved time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn an industry with so many variables in typical years, it is extremely satisfying to have had a project of this magnitude go so well in extraordinary times, with pandemic uncertainties and significantly longer lead times for material and equipment,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cAll our great partners \u2013 from the owner, general contractor, vendors, and the Sturgeon Electric team \u2013 are what made that success possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read News: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sturgeonelectric.com\/news\/fantastic-partner-sturgeon-electric-delivers-excellence-on-shamrock-foods-project\/\">\u2018Fantastic Partner\u2019 Sturgeon Electric Delivers Excellence on Shamrock Foods Project<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>While these projects especially stand out, our companies consistently provide exceptional work to their commercial and utility customers.
