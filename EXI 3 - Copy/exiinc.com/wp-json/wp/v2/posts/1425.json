WPE received the following Outstanding Achievement Awards:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Life Member Inductee \u2013 Ron Fettback<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifetime Achievement \u2013 Fettback Brothers (David Fettback\/ Ron Fettback \/ Wayne Fettback) Together, the Fettback brothers were recognized as talented and trusted leaders, who dedicate themselves to continuously improving standards in the construction industry.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Safety: Zero Frequency Injury Rate \u2013 WPE for achieving a zero-frequency injury rate in the category of Trade Contractor 200,000 or more person hours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THE WINNING WORK<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stanton Territorial Hospital. <\/strong>At 320,000 square feet, the new Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife is the largest hospital in the Northwest Territories and the largest construction project in the territory\u2019s history. Every in-patient room in the hospital is private and includes a bathroom and at least one window. Adjacent Frame Lake, many of the rooms have views. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each floor features a specific design and color scheme inspired by a Northern landscape, including lakes of the territory, rivers, and forests, mountains, and the Arctic region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complex project drew crews from all over the country, which required a high level of planning and organization to manage. Additionally, WPE\u2019s team used Bluebeam software to help track and manage areas efficiently and in real-time. WPE supplied labour, materials, and equipment to complete all electrical systems related to the construction of the Stanton Territorial Hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lougheed Mall Food Court. <\/strong>Part of the overall redevelopment of Lougheed Town Centre, the new dining area &#8212; called The Eateries \u2013 can seat 600 patrons and is home to more than 13 restaurants. WPE supplied and installed the labour, materials, and equipment to complete all electrical systems related to food court\u2019s construction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pacific Center Distribution Upgrade.<\/strong> This project is part of updates required for a recently renovated and expanded shopping mall in the heart of downtown Vancouver. At more than 400,00 square feet, it is the largest mall in downtown Vancouver and hosts 2.8 million visitors annually.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WPE replaced two high-voltage switchgear assemblies within the Pacific Centre main electrical room, replaced four high-voltage cables from the distribution switchgear to the North and the South retail vaults, and replaced the electrical distribution equipment that serves the mall retail space. Crews on this already complex project were further challenged because the center remained open seven days a week for the project\u2019s duration. More than 100 site shutdowns took place during the project, all of which had to occur between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. to allow the facility to operate normally for business hours.<\/p>\n\n\n<div
