A senior accounting assistant is important because we are responsible for providing the day-to-day support for the team, training, and onboarding new team members as well as managing our team\u2019s workload. We serve a valuable role in the department because of our ability to work alongside the team and upper management. This position creates a balanced approach to provide insights and ideas about the needs of our department to help management make informed decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What does a typical day on the job look like for you?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We support 11 subsidiaries, so a typical day consists of working hard to help my team find answers, troubleshoot, and resolve issues with internal and external customers to ensure payments are processed in a timely manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What do you love most about your job?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to exercise what I love to do the most \u2013 helping others and utilizing my leadership skills. I recently completed the MYR Group CORE leadership training and am fortunate that each day I get to apply what I learned so I can be a more effective leader. I also enjoy observing the behaviors of the executives around me. They are all truly amazing individuals with traits I try to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: How is the accounting department essential to the day-to-day operations of the company?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting is the heart of a company.
