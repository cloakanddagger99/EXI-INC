Yesterday and tomorrow don\u2019t matter, not even the most terrifying experience of their young lives or the total uncertainty lying ahead of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For mature eyes, it\u2019s unnerving to witness such a normal sight because everything around these kids paints the story of a terrifying, abnormal reality. Houses leveled. Belongings scattered. Vehicles washed away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You immediately comprehend what the children playing in the street simply cannot \u2013 yesterday was life-altering and tomorrow will never be the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen some God-awful things. You go to an area, they didn\u2019t evacuate, and everything is destroyed. People\u2019s whole lives are scattered across the ground,\u201d L.E. Myers Senior Operations Manager RJ Richards said. \u201cAnd you talk to these kids and ask where they were during the storm and they\u2019ll say, \u2018in that house right there.\u2019 You look at the house and are like, \u2018holy crap.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t even look like there\u2019s a place to hunker down. There\u2019s just so much physical destruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut the emotional scars a hurricane leaves on people, you can\u2019t see that just driving down the street. People lose their job, lose their house, lose their car all in one day. They\u2019re left with nothing and are evacuated to shelters. It\u2019s hard, man.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-myrgroup-project-carousel\">\r\n  <div class=\"carousel\">\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-2-1600x1000.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-2-1600x1000.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-2-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-2-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-2-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/>    <\/div>\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-3-1200x1600.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-3-1200x1600.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-3-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-3.jpg 1875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/>    <\/div>\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1236\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2-1236x1600.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2-1236x1600.jpg 1236w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2-791x1024.jpg 791w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2-768x994.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2-1186x1536.jpg 1186w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2-1582x2048.jpg 1582w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-2.jpg 1931w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1236px) 100vw, 1236px\" \/>    <\/div>\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1200x1600.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1200x1600.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW.jpg 1875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/>    <\/div>\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-1200x1600.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-1200x1600.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian.jpg 1875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/>    <\/div>\r\n      <\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\n\n\n<p>Hurricane Ian made landfall on the west coast of Florida near Fort Myers on Sept. 28, as a Category 4 hurricane, ravaging the state with winds speeds of 155 MPH and becoming the deadliest hurricane to strike Florida since 1935.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richards, who grew up in the Florida Keys and has lived through many hurricanes, can\u2019t rebuild people\u2019s homes or bring back what was lost, but what he can do is restore power to affected communities across the state.

Myers<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.harlanelectric.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harlan Electric<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gswc.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Great Southwestern Construction<\/a> were on the ground to restore power to affected communities. More than 160 MYR Group lineworkers came from around the country and tirelessly worked to repair the damage done by the storm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the unsung hero,\u201d L.E. Myers Indianapolis district manager David Boddy says with great appreciation. \u201cHe\u2019s the quarterback of all this, and without him, it falls apart and doesn\u2019t work nearly as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experience has taught Richards that preparation is critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven months before Ian hit Florida at full force, he made phone calls and coordinated with 20 utilities all over the state to get contracts finalized, ensuring that when hurricane season came (June-November), MYR Group would be ready to respond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with hurricanes is that their path is unpredictable, even a day out. So, strong relationships are invaluable because any part of the state could potentially be affected on short notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richards keeps a shop full of tools and equipment prepared and locked all year exclusively for hurricane response so that when the time comes, there are no delays or unexpected inventory problems. He also keeps a robust call list of more than 300 lineworkers he can reach out to for emergency restoration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote is-style-default has-border-color has-myrgroup-blue-color has-text-color\" style=\"border-color:#ffffff\"><blockquote><p>He&#8217;s the unsung hero. He&#8217;s the quarterback of all this, and withouth him, it falls apart and doesn&#8217;t work nearly as well.&#8221;<\/p><cite>&#8211; L.E. Myers Indianapolis District Manager David Boddy<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He\u2019s even streamlined the hiring paperwork and orientation process so that new lineworkers coming to work the storm are in and out to respond in the field within half a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As hurricane season approaches, Richards coordinates with district managers and vice presidents across MYR Group, determining which districts and projects have the flexibility to release lineworkers to respond to storms. This not only aids the emergency response effort but also limits negative impacts across all subsidiaries and districts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, Richards has as many as eight people coming to him for answers \u2013 all on the same call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the cool operator. He doesn\u2019t freak out or get stressed,\u201d Boddy said. \u201cI was more stressed than he was and I\u2019m not even in the hurricane.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thaddeus Laventure, a general foreman with L.E. Myers and Richards\u2019 \u201cright-hand man\u201d for hurricane response, has worked roughly 20 hurricanes in his 12 years as a lineworker. Laventure admires just how calm Richards remains, even as everyone looks to him for guidance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRJ\u2019s a lineman first, so he knows everything that has to go into it. He\u2019s a very personable guy and he\u2019s definitely the person you want doing it,\u201d Laventure said. \u201cThis was the first time I\u2019ve seen it behind the scenes and it\u2019s a ton of work. But for him, it was just like any other day at the office.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richards is friendly and speaks with a subtle Southern drawl, and it doesn\u2019t take long to understand why he\u2019s able to foster so many strong relationships that play a pivotal role at the center of the company\u2019s hurricane response efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/lemyers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6730\" style=\"width:291px;height:387px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1200x1600.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Hurricane-Ian_GSW.jpg 1875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>He worked 21 straight days without a day off before, during, and in the aftermath of Ian, with a simple philosophy \u2013 if his phone rings, he answers. He appreciates the credit others heap on him for his relentless effort but is quick to deflect it elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI draw on the company and how everyone has bought into storm response, from the highest level of management. It\u2019s not just RJ over here, but the whole organization from the top down,\u201d he said. \u201cLeadership always backs me, and I feel the proudest to be an employee at MYR Group during storm time.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a sentiment shared by all those MYR Group lineworkers and others who witness a hurricane\u2019s destruction firsthand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the lineworkers, \u201cstorm chasing\u201d is an opportunity to help communities return to life in the aftermath of devastation. But it\u2019s not easy either, living out of a hotel or sometimes a tent for weeks at a time, relying on 4-6 hours of sleep, all while performing the work properly and safely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laventure says you just have to \u201cgo with the flow\u201d and that the crews he worked with took it in stride. It\u2019s when the work is finished, and the lights come back on when all the sacrifice becomes clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCrews came from all over and they were very grateful for being able to help and restore power,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you turn on the power, we joke it\u2019s a victory lap. You go by and check that everybody has power and that you didn\u2019t miss anybody. You can sense the pride these crews have for the work they do.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hazel and Doug Witter of Ormond Beach were among the millions of Floridians who lost power. Hazel sent a thank you note via Facebook to L.E. Myers and their crews for restoring their power sooner than they had expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe appreciate them coming to Florida\u2026leaving their families, to come here to restore our power.\u201d Hazel Witter wrote. \u201cThank you so much! It doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s enough, but it\u2019s from our hearts.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restored power won\u2019t erase the terror of yesterday or remove the struggles of tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s a start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re here for you when you need us most. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\">Learn more about our emergency restoration services<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>hurricane response relies on preparedness, tireless commitment, an \u2018unsung hero\u2019 at the center of it all Little children play in the street as if it was any other day.
