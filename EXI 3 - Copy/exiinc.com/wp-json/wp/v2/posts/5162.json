WPE handles the upgrades and new construction for 14 substations that power the pipeline\u2019s pumps, which move oil across Western Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manson provides insight into what a project manager\u2019s key responsibilities are and the essential tools that help him \u2013 and the company \u2013 achieve success on a <a>years-<\/a>long project. A wide range of hurdles from multiple stakeholder interests and materials shipped from overseas to, yes, even birds nesting their young, keep Manson and his team on their toes each day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What is a Project Manager at WPE and why is it important?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: The primary focus of a project manager is to take on the company\u2019s interests in relation to the execution of a project. So, meeting the client\u2019s expectations and meeting the contract requirement; nothing more, nothing less. It\u2019s a client relation exercise in making sure that you not only deliver the project they\u2019re expecting but have the intent to create a long-lasting relationship that surpasses the current project that you\u2019re in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to ask what my job is point blank, it\u2019s communication. Communicating with everybody, all the stakeholders, operating from that 30,000-foot level and seeing all the players on the board, and talking with the right people at the right time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s fun! When you see a project start coming together, it\u2019s a thing of beauty. It\u2019s great work and very rewarding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What are your daily tasks and responsibilities?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Making sure we have <a>the people<\/a> on site, with the proper safety and quality mindset so we\u2019re not doing things twice. I ensure we work toward meeting the client\u2019s schedule tracking labor and staying on budget. But there is also the opportunity to be a problem solver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We oversee contract deliverables such as quality, schedule, the contract budget, and ensuring projects are completed safely and professionally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>We have a great support system here from my immediate supervisor to two and three levels up from there. It\u2019s almost like we don\u2019t really have job titles, we\u2019re all here as a team. And that\u2019s a corporate culture. We have it here at WPE and I\u2019ve seen that throughout MYR Group as well. There\u2019s a culture of comradery. We realize if we\u2019re all doing it together, everybody benefits. It\u2019s a good feeling to be supported. <\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What does a typical day look like for you?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: A typical day starts out with a morning huddle, and we go through the plan for the day, what their challenges are, and talk about things like material procurement, engagement of the subcontractors, and engagement of the client. It\u2019s a daily discussion of things that are in the future and putting those plans in place before they can become emergencies, and instead, they\u2019re just planned activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of my day is spent with accounting and invoices, making schedule updates, following up with our quality person to see that deliverables are on schedule, and working with our joint venture partners on safety and quality, which are the two largest drivers of the project; they go hand in hand. You\u2019re always looking at the schedule or the situation and adjusting as the life of the project goes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What do you love the most about your role?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: The teamwork! There are two parts to that: the team I\u2019m in charge of, but then there are all the other stakeholders involved that are supporting you, understanding you, and working with you. Contracts by nature can have some friction because of the money involved and egos and such, but if you can get every stakeholder on board and see that you are there to be the solution, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about having a plan for their <a>ask<\/a> and providing that solution; finding ways to bring things together. That\u2019s the win and it\u2019s fulfilling \u2013 they give you that trust to do what you need to do to get it done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What do you like about being a project manager for WPE and MYR Group?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: We have a great support system here from my immediate supervisor to two and three levels up from there. It\u2019s almost like we don\u2019t really have job titles, we\u2019re all here as a team. And that\u2019s a corporate culture. We have it here at WPE and I\u2019ve seen that throughout MYR Group as well. There\u2019s a culture of comradery. We realize if we\u2019re all doing it together, everybody benefits. It\u2019s a good feeling to be supported.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What skills or traits do you think are important for a person in your role?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Organization and planning. If you\u2019re organized and you have good plans in place, that communication to everybody is confident, concise, and everybody stays informed. Keeping everybody informed reduces stress and reduces reactive circumstances. Organization and planning are really, <a>really big<\/a> for any project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1649\" height=\"1032\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Dave-Manson-2-edited.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Dave-Manson-2-edited.jpg 1649w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Dave-Manson-2-edited-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Dave-Manson-2-edited-1600x1001.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Dave-Manson-2-edited-768x481.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Dave-Manson-2-edited-1536x961.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1649px) 100vw, 1649px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: How did you end up in this role? What was your career path?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: I started as an electrical apprentice and worked my way up to a journeyman, then a foreman, then became a general foreman, and then a superintendent, just working my way up. I got involved with estimating because I wanted a new challenge and was interested in project management and budgeting. Ultimately, I became the chief estimator and that allowed me to see things from a high level and how to switch between low level and level thinking. I wanted to get into project management and came to WPE as a project manager, and it\u2019s been great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q: What advice would you give to someone interested in pursuing a career in your position?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A: My No. 1 piece of advice would be to pay attention to all things around you if you\u2019re coming up through the field. Ask questions of your supervisors. Most people are willing to talk. Ask \u2018why is this happening?\u2019 or \u2018why do we go about it this way?\u2019 Talk to a project manager, be inquisitive, and understand the bigger picture to understand why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. There are no dumb questions when learning something.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We sat down with Dave Manson, a project manager for Western Pacific Enterprises (WPE) in charge of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, a nearly 1,000-mile span of pipeline from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia.
