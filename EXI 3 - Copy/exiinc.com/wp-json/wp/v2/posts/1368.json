We\u2019ve already begun communicating information and implementing new ideas learned at the conference with our crews.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>VISIT FROM NECA EXECS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the conference, NECA CEO David Long learned of the energized work training program we provide employees. Because \u201cno hot work\u201d policies are in effect among customers and potential clients, he was intrigued and accepted the offer to visit Denver to learn more about the program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long was joined in Denver by NECA President Larry Beltramo, COO of Rosendin Electric, and NECA Safety Director Wes Wheeler. Kenny Whipple, Sturgeon Electric District Manager Bryce Perkins, and Regional Safety Manager Zach Valdez helped with the meeting. As a result, MYR Group subsidiaries plan to teach a breakout class on energized work at next year\u2019s convention in Scottsdale, Ariz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To watch a short conference recap, <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/336873697\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"NVU 5\/20: NECA 2019 Safety Professionals Conference, Convention Registration open:\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/336873697?h=89dbbf1168&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"1778\" height=\"1000\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-myrgroup-blue-color\">SAFETY STARTS AT THE TOP, WITH A CULTURE THAT IS HARD TO TEACH AND TRAIN.
