This incredible charity provides training for dogs that go on to provide life-changing services for people in need. This includes veterans with PTSD, or folks with disabilities who need help managing their day-to-day functions. The cost to train and place one of these incredible animals averages $30,000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our kickstands first went up in 2016, Sturgeon Electric\u2019s annual poker run has raised the bar every year, adding more riders, bigger and better raffle prizes, and most importantly, financial support for this amazing cause. 2023 was our most successful event to date! We had 406 participants, $12K in prizes to give away, and more than&nbsp;<strong>$75,000 raised<\/strong>&nbsp;for Freedom Service Dogs. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sturgeon Electric would like to say a huge thank you to the volunteers who helped make this massive event safe and productive, and for your hard work to make this event possible every year. Thank you to our amazing vendors and sponsors who contributed generously to this amazing cause. On behalf of Sturgeon Electric and Freedom Service Dogs, we are immensely grateful. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To all the riders, employees, families, and friends, thank you for making the world a better place through freedom service dogs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WATCH THE RECAP<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/riLfFn4pq5I\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/riLfFn4pq5I\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.sharepoint.com\/_api\/v2.1\/sites\/myrgroup.sharepoint.com,5681c324-9c89-4627-a5b5-448896392b6f,2d41f025-c520-4ba7-b7ca-1022f1b800bd\/lists\/ef8b2e2e-7b8a-4979-b717-2e44dd508d53\/items\/b08645ba-8082-4b14-8e87-7aa3a433a6c5\/driveItem\/thumbnails\/0\/c960x99999\/content?prefer=noRedirect,extendCacheMaxAge&amp;clientType=modernWebPart\" alt=\"\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THANK YOU TO OUR VOLUNTEERS!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heather Heistand<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Greenhalge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony Ponzio<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Ponder<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monique Griswold<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisa Egan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate Egan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darryl Coleman<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paige Mclver<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Barber<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deion Wilson<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keiana Ashley- Elliot<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debbie Zdenek<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will Fry<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erik Smith<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renee Hammack<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lauren Maddox<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don Egan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krysta Brewer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Cox<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/myrgroup.sharepoint.com\/_api\/v2.1\/sites\/myrgroup.sharepoint.com,5681c324-9c89-4627-a5b5-448896392b6f,2d41f025-c520-4ba7-b7ca-1022f1b800bd\/lists\/ef8b2e2e-7b8a-4979-b717-2e44dd508d53\/items\/c3cfafaa-a7f2-4b32-bda5-251b6d4cb438\/driveItem\/thumbnails\/0\/c400x99999\/content?prefer=noRedirect,extendCacheMaxAge&amp;clientType=modernWebPart\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Mark your calendars, the 2024 Poker Run is set for July 13, 2024!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Colorado District Hosts 8th Annual Charity Ride &amp; Rally For the last eight years, Sturgeon Electric Company has hosted its annual charity ride and rally to support Freedom Service Dogs of America.
