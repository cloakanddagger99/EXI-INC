BOULOS AND HARLAN ELECTRIC COMPLETE ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION IN THE NORTHEAST: FIRSTLIGHT POWER\u2019S CABOT STATION ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANT<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two MYR Group, Inc. (MYR Group) subsidiaries, E.S. Boulos Company (E.S. Boulos) and Harlan Electric Company (Harlan Electric), combined their forces to complete upgrades to the Cabot Station Electric Generating Plant in Montague, Mass. <strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is another cooperative, successful effort between these two MYR Group subsidiaries that operate in the northeast. Crews from E.S. Boulos concentrated on the interior substation work, while Harlan Electric line workers focused on the transmission lines leading to and from the station.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope of work encompassed installing several new cable trays, re-running cables to provide proper spacing, upgrading aluminum bus and taps, reinforcing the existing lattice towers, and replacing the original conductor with a bundled 2,500 aluminum alloy conductor, some of the heaviest material the Harlan Electric crew had ever handled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgrades, engineered by TRC, were designed to increase the overall generating capacity of the power plant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>E.S. Boulos\u2019 Utility Division Director Adam Mancini cited as advantageous the solid working relationship that exists between the two electrical contractors, which started when E.S. Boulos was acquired by MYR Group in 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe respect each other\u2019s skills and territory,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cOur goal is to ensure we deliver the most qualified team to our client, and if Harlan Electric or another MYR Group subsidiary has more experience performing a particular task, we\u2019re not shy about bringing them in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly seamless process for our clients since we share the same equipment, training, safety culture, and construction management systems across subsidiaries.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>E.S. Boulos Project Manager John Carrier said the second and final outage was completed on time a week before Christmas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located along the Connecticut River, the 62-megawatt plant is owned by FirstLight Power and has generated electricity since 1916. Cabot Station provides power to communities throughout the Connecticut River Valley. At one time, it was the U.S.\u2019s largest hydroelectric station east of Niagara Falls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-myrgroup-blue-color has-text-color\"><blockquote><p><strong>OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE WE DELIVER THE MOST QUALIFIED TEAM TO OUR CLIENT, AND IF HARLAN ELECTRIC OR ANOTHER MYR GROUP SUBSIDIARY HAS MORE EXPERIENCE PERFORMING A PARTICULAR TASK, WE\u2019RE NOT SHY ABOUT BRINGING THEM IN.<\/strong><\/p><cite><strong>ADAM MANCINI, UTILITY DIVISION DIRECTOR, E.S.
