Last year alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/fire\/202113\">58,733 wildfires<\/a> burned a total of 7,139,713 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those fires hit very close to home for Colorado-based Sturgeon Electric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Dec. 30, 2021, sustained high winds and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/bou\/MarshallFire20211230\">gusts upwards of 100 miles per hour<\/a> rapidly propelled the Marshall and Middle Fork fires through densely populated suburbs southeast of Boulder. It reduced entire neighborhoods to piles of ash and twisted metal and destroyed <a href=\"https:\/\/kdvr.com\/news\/local\/boulder-fire-superior-louisville-destruction\/\">more homes<\/a> than any other wildfire in Colorado history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aftermath of such devastation, electrical crews must wreck out damaged lines and replace equipment before power can be restored to affected residents and businesses. As electrical construction firms, MYR Group subsidiaries Sturgeon Electric and Sturgeon Electric California regularly perform this kind of emergency restoration work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Immediate Response<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sturgeon Electric\u2019s Colorado gas and electric crews immediately started restoration work following the Marshall Fire. Some cleared burned trees in the area until it was safe to begin gas and electric distribution restoration work. With the smell of the fire still in the air, more than 200 workers put in roughly 16 hours a day, through snow and single-digit temperatures to restore services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis area is unique in that we have abandoned mines &#8230; we have, obviously, fire damage. We have damaged trees that are falling down in high winds,\u201d Foreman Cole Wakefield said as his crew replaced poles in one Superior, Colo. neighborhood. He added that the mental anguish of watching people return to find their homes destroyed was an added weight on all the crew members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;This is unlike anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before. Catastrophic damage. It&#8217;s unreal.&#8221;<\/p><cite>&#8211; Foreman Cole Wakefield, Sturgeon Electric (an MYR Group Company)<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the severe destruction to many properties, gas line restoration work first required finding buried risers, meters, and locating the shut off valves at each property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have to give it to our crew members. We left no one without gas. If we could turn them back on, we did,\u201d Foreman Trenton Greene recalled. \u201cA 90-year-old lady was standing outside with her 2-year-old granddaughter at 11 p.m. just asking for the heat to be turned on \u2013 so that\u2019s what our [crews] did.

The vertical nature of the project was just one potential hazard, in addition to bears, bobcats, mountain lions and rattlesnakes that roam this land. The crews were careful to protect the environment and sensitive species and plants in the work area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun Kehrmeyer, a wildlife biologist with Aspen Environmental Group, worked with Sturgeon California to protect the native habitat. \u201cWorking with Sturgeon Electric and the crews out here on the repower project, communication\u2019s been good and cooperation\u2019s been great on the environmental side of things,\u201d Kehrmeyer said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>System Hardening for Fire Mitigation<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Sturgeon-Electric-Distribution-Ward-CO-2021-036-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Two men at work on a power pole surrounded by evergreen trees.\" class=\"wp-image-4753\" style=\"width:512px;height:342px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Sturgeon-Electric-Distribution-Ward-CO-2021-036-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Sturgeon-Electric-Distribution-Ward-CO-2021-036-1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Sturgeon-Electric-Distribution-Ward-CO-2021-036-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Sturgeon-Electric-Distribution-Ward-CO-2021-036-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Sturgeon-Electric-Distribution-Ward-CO-2021-036-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sturgeon Electric works to harden power systems in Ward, Colo. as part of a larger wildfire mitigation program. <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With growing concerns over drought and wildfires many utilities are initiating electrical infrastructure hardening projects designed to reduce the risk of wildfires. Both Sturgeon Electric and Sturgeon California are doing extensive wildfire hardening for their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Colorado, Sturgeon is involved with a multi-year project which has included replacing more than 7,600 poles since September 2019. Roughly 2,500 more pole replacements are planned for 2022. They have also begun replacing more than 60 miles of conductor with tree wire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite the project \u2026 we\u2019ve got helicopters helping us with the locations. These are off-grid, off-truck accessible locations if that makes sense, so we use a helicopter to speed up the process,\u201d General Foreman Kevin Brown said of some of that hardening work that was done in Ward, Colo. in late 2021. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past decade, the impact of wildfires has been significant. Whether our customers need emergency restoration due to wildfires, rebuild or mitigation and hardening support, Sturgeon Electric and MYR Group stand ready for the task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" data-id=\"4754\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-3-1600x900.jpg\" alt=\"A few lineworkers setting a power line pole.\" class=\"wp-image-4754\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-3-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" data-id=\"4755\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-2-1600x900.jpg\" alt=\"A helicopter flies above an area where power poles lay on the ground waiting for installation in California.\" class=\"wp-image-4755\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-2-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" data-id=\"4756\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-Cogswell-Dam-Sturgeon-CA-web-3-1600x900.jpg\" alt=\"Trucks and electrical workers on a ridge as a power line pole is raised by a helicopter.\" class=\"wp-image-4756\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-Cogswell-Dam-Sturgeon-CA-web-3-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-Cogswell-Dam-Sturgeon-CA-web-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-Cogswell-Dam-Sturgeon-CA-web-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-Cogswell-Dam-Sturgeon-CA-web-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bobcat-Fire-Restoration-Cogswell-Dam-Sturgeon-CA-web-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Scenes from the Bobcat Fire Restoration Project performed by Sturgeon Electric California.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Details:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/projects\/cogswell-reservoir-bobcat-fire-restoration\/\">Cogswell Reservoir\/Bobcat Fire Restoration<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our subsidiaries can rebuild power lines damaged by wildfires in even the most rugged terrain and perform critical system hardening upgrades. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\"><strong>See our emergency restoration <\/strong>services<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crews also upgrade electric infrastructure for wildfire mitigation programS Wildfires are an ongoing threat to communities, especially in the western U.S. during prolonged periods of drought.
