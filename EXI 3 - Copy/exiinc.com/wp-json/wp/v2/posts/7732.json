At the age of 17, he made the life-altering decision to join the Marine Corps. Dan&#8217;s motivation to serve came from the values instilled in him by his mother, who emphasized service to others before self. His 30-year career in the U.S. Marine Corps was marked by both adventures and the grim realities of warfare. He candidly shared, &#8220;Seeing death, causing death, living with death is something I shall never forget. The overwhelming guilt of losing so many of my brothers in combat.&#8221; Dan&#8217;s story embodies the immense sacrifices made by military personnel in their service to the nation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wounded Warriors Project provided Dan with a lifeline. He spoke of how the organization gave him a sense of meaning and the belief that he could continue making a positive impact on the world. Events like this tournament offer wounded warriors like Dan an opportunity to be among fellow veterans and patriots, forging a sense of camaraderie that is invaluable for their emotional healing and well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to make the Wounded Warriors Project the recipient of this year&#8217;s tournament was not made lightly. The event was a huge success with 103 golfers participating and more than $46,000 raised. These contributions play a significant role in advancing the Wounded Warrior Project&#8217;s mission, which is to honor and empower individuals like Dan. The organization achieves this through direct programs in mental health, career counseling, and long-term rehabilitative care, as well as advocacy efforts to ensure the welfare of veterans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of this charity golf tournament is a testament to the generosity and support of our sponsors, participants, and employees who have rallied behind this noble cause. Without your continued dedication, this event would not have been possible!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-id=\"7735\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1213-1-1600x1066.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7735\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1213-1-1600x1066.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1213-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1213-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1213-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1213-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-id=\"7734\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1234-3-1600x1066.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7734\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1234-3-1600x1066.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1234-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1234-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1234-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1234-3.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-id=\"7738\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1239-1-1600x1066.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7738\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1239-1-1600x1066.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1239-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1239-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1239-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1239-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-id=\"7737\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1244-1-1600x1066.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7737\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1244-1-1600x1066.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1244-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1244-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1244-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1244-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-id=\"7736\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1253-1-1600x1066.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7736\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1253-1-1600x1066.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1253-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1253-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1253-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1253-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-id=\"7739\" src=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1259-1-1600x1066.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7739\" srcset=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1259-1-1600x1066.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1259-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1259-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1259-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/exiinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_1259-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The L.E.
