MYR Group subsidiary E.S. Boulos was proud to support the hospital\u2019s desire to meet more patients\u2019 needs by providing the electrical construction services for Northern Light Mercy Hospital\u2019s recent renovation and expansion project which began in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project had three parts: expanding the existing hospital building by 65,000 square feet, adding a new specialty medicine and surgery center, and renovating an existing medical office building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the medical office building was in use, E.S. Boulos changed the entire electrical service of the building in a single weekend \u2013 a challenge they successfully managed by having the right team. Nick Marchant, E.S. Boulos\u2019 district manager, said it was exactly the kind of \u201ccomplex\u201d project the company likes to take on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>E.S. Boulos was previously involved with the hospital construction in 2006. That brought continuity to the project, which the owner appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Details:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/esboulos.com\/projects\/outpatient-specialty-and-surgery-center\/\">Outpatient Specialty and Surgery Center<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whether a new build, expansion or renovation and upgrades, our companies have electrical construction for your commercial projects covered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/exiinc.com\/capabilities\/commercial-industrial-construction\/\">Find out what they can do<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>THREE-IN-ONE PROJECT EXACTLY THE KIND OF COMPLEX PROJECT THE SUBSIDIARY LIKES TO TAKE ON Northern Light Mercy Hospital (formerly Mercy Hospital) has been caring for patients in Portland, Maine since its founding in 1918.
