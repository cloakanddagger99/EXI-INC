Meyers AND STURGEON ELECTRIC DISTRICT\u2019S FOR EARNING COVETED HONOR FROM OSHA&#8217;S VOLUNTARY PROTECTION PROGRAM (VPP) SINCE 2008<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The L.E. Meyers Co. (L.E. Myers) Chattanooga District and Sturgeon Electric Company, Inc. (Sturgeon Electric) Colorado District have maintained STAR status through the VPP, an OSHA initiative that promotes workplace health and safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To determine a company\u2019s eligibility, OSHA conducts an extensive evaluation of jobsite safety, policies and procedures, safety protocols, and training. Companies that meet the program\u2019s stringent criteria receive STAR status, the VPP\u2019s highest award.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the VPP recognizes employers and employees for developing and implementing continuous improvement in workplace safety and health management programs that result in injury\/illness rates below the national average. Careful attention is paid to efforts related to hazard prevention and control, worksite analysis, proper training, and teamwork between the company\u2019s management group and workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EXCELLENCE IS TEAM EFFORT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining the highest level of safety excellence is a difficult, extensive undertaking that takes team effort, L.E. Meyers and Sturgeon Electric leaders say. Recertification requires teamwork, coordination, and dedication and every team member plays a key role. They also give a shout out to the individuals who worked closely with the OSHA inspectors throughout the audit, noting that their commitment and devotion led to each district\u2019s success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy granting STAR status, OSHA has made a public statement that they trust Sturgeon to lead the industry to a better place regarding employee health and safety,\u201d C&amp;I Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Waneka says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of our core values, Safety has become instilled in everything we do, says L.E. Myers District Manager Jayson Scali.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think our team looks at VPP or our safety program as something we have to \u2018get ready for,\u2019\u201d Scali says. \u201cWe truly have an environment that has been created here allowing us to just manage our business and this is just a part of how we do business.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CERTIFICATION SIGNIFICANCE<\/strong> By maintaining VPP STAR certification year over year, L.E. Myers and Sturgeon Electric demonstrate to our clients, prospects, and employees that the health and safety of our people is our No. 1 priority. We actively prove that we are among the best in the industry through our actions, behaviors, and commitments to achieving top-tier safety performance. STAR status instills confidence in our clients, prospects, and employees that we constantly strive keep our people and worksites as safe as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color has-myrgroup-blue-color\"><p><strong>I hope that when CLIENTS SEE HOW LONG WE\u2019VE BEEN IN THE VPP PROGRAM THEY HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW COMMITTED WE ARE AS A COMPANY TO SAFETY AND QUALITY AND, WITH that, THEY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE GREAT SERVICE TO THEM.<\/strong><\/p><cite><strong>HEATHER SHOGBAIKE, SAFETY SPECIALIST, THE L.E.
