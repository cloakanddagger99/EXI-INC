This year was another record-breaking success! We had 460 participants, surpassing last year&#8217;s count of 406. We also gave away $12K in prizes and raised over $100,000 for Freedom Service Dogs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Sturgeon Electric would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the volunteers who ensured the event was safe and productive, and to everyone who contributes to making this event possible each year.
