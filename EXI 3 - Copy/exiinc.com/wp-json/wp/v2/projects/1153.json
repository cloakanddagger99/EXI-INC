By collaborating intensely, using innovative technology, and with excellent leadership, our team reduced the electrical schedule by 18 months. At the peak of the project, 350 electricians were working on site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Rocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center replaces&nbsp;&nbsp;the former Denver VA Hospital built in 1950.
